This particular video shows a puppy wearing a cone of shame, tail wagging. The puppy tumbles down some stairs. Gets up, tail still wagging. It‚Äôs cute, in a cartoonish way. Nothing like the stuff that happens to animals the Enforcement team routinely sees. Which besides, is generally allowed on the site.

Slightly misogynistic. But somebody probably finds it funny. The Impact font softens the blow and the GIF blends in with all the other memes.
